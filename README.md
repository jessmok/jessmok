### Hi, I’m Jessie!

I currently work as an SDE on the Alexa Automobile team at Amazon, Irvine. I graduated March 2021 from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science.

I often thrive in areas where I’m pushing boundaries to develop new technology. To explore those boundaries, I've completed a wide range of projects that you can read about in detail on my [website](www.jessmok.com).

Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessmok/) or at [hello@jessmok.com](mailto:hello@jessmok.com) with any questions, growth opportunities, or even just to say hi!
